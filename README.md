# What is this?

This dashboard was built for Reneal IEO, a non-profit that captures old and discarded computers to build computer labs for students in Tanzania and the Philippines, to enable Reneal IEO to monitor the health and utilization of their computer labs and improve their allocation of computers to better-utilized computer labs.

For more information on Reneal IEO, please visit their website here: https://www.reneal.org/
